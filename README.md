In vitro cellular experimentation with genetic interventions, using for example CRISPR technologies, is an essential 
step in early-stage drug discovery and target validation that serves to assess initial hypotheses about causal 
associations between biological mechanisms and disease pathologies. With billions of potential hypotheses to test, 
the experimental design space for in vitro genetic experiments is extremely vast, and the available experimental 
capacity - even at the largest research institutions in the world - pales in relation to the size of this biological 
hypothesis space. 

[GeneDisco (published at ICLR-22)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11875) is a benchmark suite for evaluating active learning algorithms for experimental design in drug discovery. 
GeneDisco contains a curated set of multiple publicly available experimental data sets as well as open-source i
mplementations of state-of-the-art active learning policies for experimental design and exploration.
